As a graduate student studying Data Science at Harvard University with a background in Computer Science from IIT Tirupati, I now serve as a Research Assistant at the Culture and Cognition and Coevolution lab. At the CCC Lab, my work is focussed on the application of Natural language processing techniques to study questions in psychology, human behaviour and cognition. I have worked as a Data Scientist and ML engineer in the past, where my focus was on working with time-series data. I strive to merge these diverse pursuits into a comprehensive understanding of our complex world.
