I am an assistant professor in the Entrepreneurial Management Unit at Harvard Business School. 

My fields of research are economic development, political economy, economics of gender, and behavioral economics.

I earned my Ph.D. from the University of Bonn. Prior to joining HBS, I was a postdoctoral researcher in Joe Henrich's Culture, Cognition, and Coevolution Lab at Harvard University.
