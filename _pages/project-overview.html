<p>What factors promote liberty and free markets? Why did representative governments, impartial laws and
  impersonal markets first develop and proliferate in medieval Europe?</p>
  
  <p>In this project, we’ll explore the hypothesis that the successful diffusion of these political, legal and
economic institutions is strongly influenced by people’s social organization, and particularly their family
structure. Unconstrained by the demands of strong kin-based institutions (such as the clan, polygyny, or
kin marriages), individuals develop a more individualistic psychology. This new way of thinking fosters
not only greater liberty and freer markets, but also democratic societies built around individual rights.</p>
  
  <p>Our previous work (1) (2) (3) has linked the Medieval Catholic Church’s regulations on marriage – their
marriage and family program – to weak kin-based institutions (dominated by the neolocal nuclear family)
    and a more individualistic-impersonal psychology in the contemporary world (see figure below).</p>

    <p>In this project, we’ll construct several novel databases. Large-scale corpora on historical texts will allow
      our <a href="https://historicalpsychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/">interdisciplinary team</a> to capture psychological change and the transformation of the family
stretching over centuries all the way back to Antiquity. By tracing psychological change over time
through computational linguistic methods this project will make inroads to the nascent field of historical
      psychology [link to what we write about historical psychology].</p>
  
  <p>In addition, we’ll explore how family organizations impact people’s psychology, innovation, and
prosperity in the contemporary world. We’ll design laboratory experiments, lab-in-the-field experiments,
conduct anthropological field, and use genetic, and anthropological data, and satellite imaginary (4) to explore these questions.</p>
