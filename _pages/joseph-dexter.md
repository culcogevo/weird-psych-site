Joseph Dexter is a Harvard Data Science Fellow and co-founder and co-director of the Quantitative Criticism Lab. A computational biologist by training, he works on applications of text analysis to problems that span the humanities, social sciences, and biomedicine and public health, including the development of natural language processing methods for premodern languages and studies of the cultural evolution of literature. His contributions to the Templeton-funded project will focus on the measurement of psychological change using diachronic corpora of Latin literature.
