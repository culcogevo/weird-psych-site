My training has been in biology for the most part, and I have extensive experience in evolutionary theory, evolutionary psychology, evolutionary anthropology (gene-culture coevolution), and cognitive science. Research-wise, I use methodologically diverse approaches (e.g., theoretical modeling, quantitative analysis of historical data, ethnographic fieldwork) to study human behavior and culture, with special attention paid to information processing at the individual level and information transmission at the population level. 

For this project, I will help data collection in the southwest of China for comparative analysis.
