Sara Lowes is an Assistant Professor of Economics at UC San Diego. Much of her research explores how culture shapes development outcomes. For example, she examines how matrilineal kinship systems affect outcomes for women and children and shape psychological traits, such as trust, cooperation, and preference for competition.
