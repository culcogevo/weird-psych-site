Augustin Bergeron is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Stanford King center on Global Development. He will join the University of Southern California (USC) as an Assistant Professor of Economics in Fall 2022. His research interests lie at the intersection of development economics and political economy. His primary research agenda explores the determinants of state capacity and tax capacity in particular. His second agenda focuses on the origins of social ties (especially kinship) and their effects on development. His field work is based in the D.R. Congo, where he helps manage a non-profit survey organization called Odeka. 

For this project, he will work with Sara Lowes and Nathan Nunn to implement surveys and behavioral experiments to obtain individual-level measures of psychology, religion, family organization, and people's attitudes towards liberty, freedom, and democracy in Kananga, DRC.
