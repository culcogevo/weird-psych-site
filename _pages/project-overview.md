##What Big Question will your project help answer?

Q1. What features of people’s cultural psychology foster economic prosperity, rapid innovation and the effective functioning of impersonal (secular) institutions, such as democratic governments, modern corporations and free markets?

Using a range of psychological measures, assessed from historical sources and using both surveys and experimental tools drawn from the cognitive sciences, we will examine the relationships between psychology and important economic and political outcomes. As part of this, we’ll ask how important is human psychology compared to all the usual factors that economists focus on to explain outcomes in the political economy, such as natural resources, access to waterways, or soil fertility? We hypothesis that a population’s cultural psychology will be an important factor in determining economic and political outcomes.

Q2. Why do people in diverse societies and back into history think, feel and reason differently? What are the origins of this psychological variation?

Though we’ll conduct a full exploration of the economic, educational, ecological, religious, environmental and epidemiological factors that may help explain global psychological differences, our key theoretical and empirical focus will be on how the organization of families—or what anthropologists call kin-based institutions—influence people’s relational networks and ultimately their psychology. This analysis will allow us to ask how important kin-based institutions are in explaining people’s psychology relative to a wide range of other factors, such as individual income or schooling, that are often deemed to be important.

Q3. How can we explain the substantial variation in kin-based institutions around the globe? How much are a population’s kin-based institutions influenced by cultural inheritance—the norms and customs of their forebears—vs. the current material, economic and ecological
constraints and incentives? What is the role of religion, ecology, geography, warfare, disease and other shocks in shaping kin-based institutions?

In particular, our theory proposes that world religions have substantially transformed kin-based institutions in distinct directions. Western Christianity, for example, dissolved clans in many regions of Europe and tabooed cousin marriage. The resulting customs construct quite
different kin-based social networks, which we hypothesize generated substantial downstream consequences for people’s psychological and political-economic outcomes.
