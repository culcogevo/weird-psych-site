My research focuses on Economic Growth, Development, History and Culture. I am particularly interested in the deep-rooted factors that shape the coevolution of culture and institutions. I combine theory of human development and cultural evolution with empirical analysis based on survey, experimental, ethnographic, historic and geographic data to explore these questions.
