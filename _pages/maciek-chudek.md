My <a href='https://chudek.org'>previous work</a> focused on using <i>psychological evidence</i> (e.g., experiments run on contemporary humans) to test <i>historical hypotheses</i> (i.e., gene-cultural coevolutionary models). After a long break from academia, I'm now joining the Culture, Cognition, & Coevolution lab to explore how <i>historical evidence</i> (i.e., NLP-based analyses of historical texts) can test <i>psychological hypotheses</i> (i.e., claims about how minds work).
