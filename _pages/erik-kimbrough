Erik O. Kimbrough, PhD, is an Associate Professor of Economics in the Smith Institute for Political Economy and Philosophy at Chapman Universityâ€™s Argyros School of Business and Economics. Kimbrough's research uses experiments to study the economics of rule-following, social norms, conflict resolution, cooperation and institutions, among other topics. I'll be helping to design and analyze some experiments to understand cross-cultural variation in the degree of in-group and kin favoritism.
