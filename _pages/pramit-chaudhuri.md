Pramit Chaudhuri is Associate Professor of Classics at the University of Texas at Austin and the co-founder and co-director of the Quantitative Criticism Lab. He specializes in the Latin poetic genres of epic and tragedy and their reception in early modern Europe, with a particular interest in the representation of conflict and diplomacy. His work with QCL has two principal aims: to develop mixed methods approaches to the analysis of literature, and to apply insights drawn from the study of literature to domains outside the traditional humanities. His contributions to the Templeton-funded project will focus on the use of Latin corpora for text-based historical psychology.
