## Welcome to the Historical Psychology Project!

What are the factors that promote economic prosperity, rapid innovation, and representative democracy, and why did these first develop in medieval Europe? These are the questions that the Historical Psychology Project seeks to answer. 

The central hypothesis underlying this project is that changes in family structure can drastically change people’s psychologies, and that a peculiar set of psychological changes brought about the diffusion of many WEIRD institutions. But how do kinship networks shape psychology? 

Most cultures have strong kinship networks. This is because kin are more reliable for cooperation: People have evolved an innate tendency to be altruistic towards genetic relatives, and through the process of cultural evolution, groups have exploited this innate inclination towards kin to create kinship networks that promote cooperation. One way to exploit these innate inclinations is through the creation of norms, and these norms in turn influence psychological tendencies. These norms and psychological tendencies—such as deference to traditions/elders, strong in-group favoritism/trust, and honor/corporate responsibility—intensified interpersonal bonds and forged tightly knit, cooperative groups, allowing societies to scale up.

However, in medieval Europe, something strange happened. The church decided, arbitrarily, to impose a set of rules and norms—e.g., prohibitions on marriage between blood relatives, prohibitions on polygynous marriage, encouragement of neolocal residence—that weakened kinship ties. This disruption of kinship networks meant that individuals could no longer rely on kin for support. Instead, individuals often needed to forge mutually beneficial relationships with strangers. To cooperate with strangers rather than kin, and new suite of psychological traits and values formed. When cooperating with strangers, one must be tolerant of differences and be open novelty. On top of that, one must carefully select individuals who can provide the highest payoffs. This means that to be chosen as a cooperator one must “sell themselves” by setting themselves apart based on their personal attributes, specialized abilities, and dispositional values, not primarily on friendships, lineages, or family alliances. Thus began the rise of individualism. One must also know whom to trust and convince others to trust them. To do so, cultural evolution favored stronger use of intentions in moral judgements and more guilt, rather than shame. These psychological changes set the stage for the WEIRD institutions we know today, like democracy, constitutional law, and science, as many of these institutions rely heavily on cooperation with strangers and on individualism, which encouraged analytic thinking, the generation of novel ideas, and the rejection of tradition, all of which led to accelerating innovation. 

This project seeks to explore this hypothesis at three levels of analysis. First, using global data, we’ll assess the relationship between the strength of kin networks and economic outcomes within countries around the world. Then, zooming in, we’ll use online surveys to collect individual-level data from participants in 6 countries on psychology, family, and political attitudes. Finally, we’ll deploy teams of anthropologists, psychologists and economists to field sites in Africa, China and Oceania to collect detailed data using custom-designed experiments and ethnographic interviews. Using historical records, we’ll trace the origins of liberty, individual rights and representative democracy back through the Middle Ages to the transformation of the family initiated by the Catholic Church. Moving forward in time from late antiquity and eventually through U.S. history, we’ll develop new techniques to extract psychological and kinship measures from textual corpora and then explore how psychology and kinship coevolve with representative governments, economic prosperity, voter enfranchisement, oppression and innovation.
